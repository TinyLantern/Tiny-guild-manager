# Guild Management System for Throne and Liberty

## Overview
This project is a web-based guild management system designed for the MMORPG *Throne and Liberty*. It provides guild leaders and members with tools to manage guild activities, organize parties, handle applications, and track member details. The application features a clean, dark-themed interface with a focus on usability, built using Quasar (Vue.js) for the frontend and Laravel with MySQL for the backend. This system was developed as a personal project to explore modern web development frameworks.

## Features
- **Discord Authentication**: Users can securely log in using their Discord accounts, leveraging Discordâ€™s OAuth for authentication, ensuring a seamless and trusted login experience tied to their gaming community identity.
- **Activity Scheduling**: A calendar-based interface for scheduling guild activities, with options to add, view, and delete events.
